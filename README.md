# ux-workflow-builder (AI)

---

A workflow builder, highly popularized by AI recently, is a visual interface that allows users to create automated processes by connecting steps together, much like building blocks. 

Instead of writing code, users drag and drop nodes—such as triggers, actions, and conditions—onto a canvas and draw connections between them to define how data flows. Each node represents a step in the process, and the branching paths or sequences show the logic of how the workflow should run. The experience feels like sketching out a flowchart, but with interactive parts that actually execute tasks across apps and systems. This makes complex automation intuitive and accessible, empowering users to design and manage processes through a clear, visual map.
